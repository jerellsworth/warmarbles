# next
* optimize collision detection. Probably turn off collision for gutter marbles
  - add a "in tray" flag.
    ~ don't check collision when in tray
    ~ turn off flag when guy grabs marble
  - max physics objects only needs to be like 20 rather than 80
* Do blog post with early footage, discuss cool monster and throwing animation
* You lose if all the marbles are in your tray
* rounds
* bumpers
* bumpers grow in most used space between rounds
* sounds
* better AI
* marbles need darker outline
* shading on target

# eventually

# bugs
* need to stop throwing immediately when game ends so we don't write to uninitialized memory
