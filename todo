# next
* production logo (frogseye lense to make it look like it's reflected in a marble)
* pause
* make music quiter
* better AI
* change criteria to 10 games one instead of 2
* paint the walls with circuit-ish texture skewed to wall position
* palette fade on title screen from yellow to red to make title glow
* collision detection optimization

# eventually
* after a few seconds of being still, marbles sitting on board are propelled in a random direction

# bugs
* need to stop throwing immediately when game ends so we don't write to uninitialized memory
* marble getting stuck in target
* holding left lets you throw the marble off screen
* board clear doodads missing last doodad
