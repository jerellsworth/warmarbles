# next
* bumpers grow in most used space between rounds
  - bumpers are not appearing in the right places
* if marble gets stuck in a bumper, just blow the marble up and drop in a new one
    - maybe count number of consecutive frames with a collison. Track last collision frame and number of frames with collision
* collision detection optimization
* speed ups
* animation when marbles are warping in
* after a few seconds of being still, marbles sitting on board are propelled in a random direction
* sounds
* better AI
* paint the walls with circuit-ish texture skewed to wall position

# eventually

# bugs
* need to stop throwing immediately when game ends so we don't write to uninitialized memory
* marble getting stuck in target
