# next
* animation for marbles being accelerated
  - color changes to same color as the accelerators
* collision detection optimization
* animation when marbles are warping in
* after a few seconds of being still, marbles sitting on board are propelled in a random direction
* sounds
* better AI
* paint the walls with circuit-ish texture skewed to wall position

# eventually

# bugs
* need to stop throwing immediately when game ends so we don't write to uninitialized memory
* marble getting stuck in target
