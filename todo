* end state
  - 1st to 10?

* menu
* production logo (frogseye lense to make it look like it's reflected in a marble)
* collision detection optimization
* sounds
* better AI

# eventually
* after a few seconds of being still, marbles sitting on board are propelled in a random direction

* marble getting stuck in target
* holding left lets you throw the marble off screen
