* targets appear less often than every point. Maybe every 3
* collision detection optimization
* sounds
* better AI
* paint the walls with circuit-ish texture skewed to wall position
* title screen & end state

# eventually
* after a few seconds of being still, marbles sitting on board are propelled in a random direction

# bugs
* need to stop throwing immediately when game ends so we don't write to uninitialized memory
* marble getting stuck in target
* holding left lets you throw the marble off screen
